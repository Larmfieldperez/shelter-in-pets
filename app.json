    "description": "Shelter-in-Pets is a mobile application that streamlines a user’s search for adoptable dogs. It matches user-uploaded dog images to similar adoptable dogs, allows a user to conduct filtered searches based on desired traits, and even recommends adoptable dogs based on the user’s in-app activity. We hope that these features will help simplify the dog adoption process, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing protocols, and help more pups find new homes. Shelter-in-Pets was built by Angela Vuong, Laura Armfield-Perez, Katherine Lee and Sonia Susanto. Please note that only Android phones are able to load the app via scanning the QR code. For iPhone users, please feel free to visit our Github page for more information on how to access our app.",
